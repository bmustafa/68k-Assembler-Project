My project is an assembler that is supposed to mimic 68000 IDE as closely as possible.
Operators that have been coded for include DIVU, MULU, ADD, SUB, BRA, BEQ, BLT, BGT, MOVE, CMP, SWAP, STOP
Directives that have been coded for include END, ORG, DC, DS
There are 3 addressing modes: Address register, Data register and Memory
The STOP Instruction has been hardcoded for the #$2700, it should not affect performance

My Test Files:
Testfile: Data after instructions and simple instructions
Testfile 6: Data before instruction and every possible
	     combination of instructions
Testfile 7: Same as 6 but seperated the locations of Data and
            instructions

Instructions:
      Run file and name the file who would like to open. Output will 
	be printed as well as saved as a Hex file
